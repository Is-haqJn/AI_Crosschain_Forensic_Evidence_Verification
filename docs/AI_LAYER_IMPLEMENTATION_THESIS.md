## What Worked

### 1. Architecture Design
**Success**: The microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns proved effective.

**Key Benefits**:
- Modular design allows independent development and testing
- Easy to scale individual components
- Clear API boundaries between services
- Maintainable codebase with single responsibility principle

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# Clean separation of concerns
class ImageProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_manager = get_model_manager()
        self.supported_formats = settings.IMAGE_ALLOWED_FORMATS
    
    async def analyze(self, file_path: str, request: AnalysisRequest) -> ImageAnalysisResult:
        # Clear, focused responsibility
```

### 2. Model Management System
**Success**: Centralized model manager with fallback mechanisms.

**Key Benefits**:
- Consistent model loading across all processors
- Graceful degradation when models are unavailable
- Memory-efficient caching with LRU eviction
- Easy model versioning and updates

**Implementation Highlights**:
```python
class ModelManager:
    async def get_model(self, model_name: str) -> Optional[Any]:
        # Check cache first
        if model_name in self.model_cache:
            return self.model_cache[model_name]
        
        # Load with fallback
        model = await self._load_model(model_name)
        if model:
            await self._add_to_cache(model_name, model)
        return model
```

### 3. File Handling System

- Secure temporary file handling with auto-cleanup
- File integrity verification with hash checking
- Support for multiple file formats

**Security Features**:
- MIME type validation
- File size limits

- Hash-based integrity checking

### 4. Async/Await Pattern
**Success**: Consistent use of async/await throughout the application.

**Key Benefits**:
- Non-blocking I/O operations
- Better resource utilization
- Scalable concurrent processing
- Clean error handling

**Example Implementation**:
```python
async def analyze(self, file_path: str, request: AnalysisRequest) -> ImageAnalysisResult:
    # Run all analysis components in parallel
    tasks = [
        self._detect_manipulation(image, file_path),
        self._analyze_similarity(image, file_path),
        self._extract_exif_data(file_path),
        self._detect_objects(image),
        self._detect_faces(image)
    ]
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

### 5. Type Safety with Pydantic
**Success**: Comprehensive type safety and validation.

**Key Benefits**:
- Runtime type checking

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Model Loading Strategy
**Issue**: Initial attempt to load all models at startup caused memory issues.

**Problem**:
- Models are large (hundreds of MB to GB)
- Loading all models simultaneously exceeded memory limits
- Startup time was too long

**Solution Implemented**:
- Lazy loading with on-demand model initialization
- LRU cache with configurable size limits
- Fallback mechanisms for unavailable models

**Lesson**: Always consider memory constraints when working with ML models.

### 2. Synchronous File Processing
**Issue**: Initial synchronous file processing caused blocking operations.

**Problem**:
- Large files caused timeouts
- Poor user experience with long wait times
- Resource underutilization

**Solution Implemented**:
- Asynchronous file processing with background tasks
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Parallel processing of analysis components

**Lesson**: Always use async patterns for I/O-intensive operations.

### 3. Hardcoded Configuration
**Issue**: Initial hardcoded values made the system inflexible.

**Problem**:
- Difficult to deploy in different environments
- No way to adjust settings without code changes
- Security risks with hardcoded secrets

**Solution Implemented**:
- Environment variable-based configuration
- Pydantic settings with validation
- Secure secret management

**Lesson**: Always externalize configuration for flexibility and security.

### 4. Error Handling
**Issue**: Initial error handling was too generic and unhelpful.

**Problem**:
- Generic error messages didn't help with debugging
- No distinction between different error types
- Poor user experience

**Solution Implemented**:
- Specific error types and messages
- Comprehensive logging with context
- Graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms

**Lesson**: Invest time in proper error handling and logging from the start.

## Technical Challenges
